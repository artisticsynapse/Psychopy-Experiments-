# Human Memory Recognition Task

![](https://github.com/artisticsynapse/Psychopy-Experiments-/blob/master/Human%20Memory%20Recognition%20Experiment/Images/Psychopy_Advance_Recognition_Memory_Task_GIF.gif)

## Description:

"**Recognition memory**, a subcategory of declarative memory, is the ability to recognize previously encountered events, objects, or people [1]. When the previously experienced event is reexperienced, this environmental content is matched to stored memory representations, eliciting matching signals".

"**Recognition memory** can be subdivided into two component processes: **recollection** and **familiarity**, sometimes referred to as "**remembering**" and "**knowing**", respectively. Recollection is the retrieval of details associated with the previously experienced event. In contrast, familiarity is the feeling that the event was previously experienced, without recollection. Thus, the fundamental distinction between the two processes is that recollection is a slow, controlled search process, whereas familiarity is a fast, automatic process. [2]"

## Aim:
The aim is to build an experiment which can study, and measure the capacity of recognition memory in indviduals. 

In this experiment, six words are shown to the participant in the study phase. These words are either green, or red, in color. After studying these words, participants are asked to proceed with the test phase whenever ready. In test pase, participants are shown twelve words, six old words from the study phase, and six new words from test phase, mixed in a random manner. All the words in the test phase are uncolored. For each word, participant has to distinguish, and present with a response as to whether the word is old (from study phase), or new.

## How to use:
### Requirements: 
Softwares:
- Psychopy: for building, and running the experiment on the participants (you can download Pyschopy by going to [this link](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html)).
- Microsoft Excel: for the ananlysis of the data collected.

Participants:
- Any person (preferably, a human being, for the ease of performing task, but you can train a monkey, or any other animal, by appropriate conditioning protocol, if you're adventourous in nature) who is willing to participate. 

### Run the task:
