### Psychopy Experiments

This repo is my brief portfolio consisting of sample experiments run in the fields of human cognitive neuroscience, and psychology, using PsychoPy, 'an open source software package written in the Python programming language primarily for use in neuroscience, and experimental psychology research'. 

"**PsychoPy** is a free cross-platform package allowing you run a wide range of experiments in the behavioral sciences (neuroscience, psychology, psychophysics, linguistics etc.)". I believe in the wide spread knowledge, and experience which open-source projects provide with, and in general, in the spirit of open science. Thus, I decided to put my hands on Psychopy to experiment with the concepts I've learned (from university courses as well as online resources) in behavioural sciences.  

The experiments designed in my portfolio have originally been inspired from the tutorials put up by **Dr. Jason Ozubko, Human Cognition and Memory Lab, SUNY Geneseo**. Although I've done my own understanding, and learning of the basics of Psychopy, made variations to the design of experiments, ran multiple experiments on my acquaintance subjects, and analyzed the data on my own; all the credits go to the creators, and developers of Psychopy, and the playlist which inspired me to experiment with these concepts, and hypotheses. Please find the links to the resources at the bottom of this document. 

I hope this stands as a portfolio to express my interest, and involvement in behavioural sciences; as well as make more visible the ease to access, flexibility, and the usefulness of modern research tools/workflow, such as 'PsychoPy', for people interested in behavioural sciences.
